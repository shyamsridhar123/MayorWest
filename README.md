## 🛡️ Security-First Autonomous Coding

> **The key differentiator**: Full autonomy doesn't mean zero safety. Mayor West Mode is the **first AI coding tool with security by architecture**, not by interruption.

### Why This Matters

Most AI coding tools today (Cline, Aider, Roo Code, Cursor) use a **human-in-the-loop** model—you approve every file change and terminal command. That's safe, but it's not autonomous.

Mayor West Mode takes a different approach: **configure once, trust the guardrails**.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 4: Audit Trail                                           │

│  └── Full GitHub Actions logs for every decision                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Plus client-side protection**: VS Code YOLO settings auto-approve safe commands (`git commit`, `npm test`) while blocking destructive ones (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`).

## What is Mayor West Mode?

Mayor West Mode is an experiment in autonomous development workflows. It configures GitHub Copilot to pick up tasks from GitHub Issues and attempt to implement, test, and merge them with minimal human intervention.

**How it works:**

```
Issue Created → Orchestrator Assigns → Copilot Executes → PR Auto-Merges → Loop
```

**Key features:**

- 🤖 **Autonomous execution** — Tasks complete without human intervention
- ⚡ **YOLO mode** — Safe commands auto-approve (tests, commits, pushes)
- 🔄 **Queue orchestration** — FIFO task processing from GitHub Issues
- 🔀 **Auto-merge** — PRs merge automatically when checks pass
- 🛡️ **Safety guardrails** — Iteration limits, blocked destructive commands

---

## Quick Start — 90 Seconds

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires Node.js 18+ and a GitHub repository with Copilot enabled.

```bash
# Step 1: Run the setup wizard
npx github:shyamsridhar123/MayorWest setup

# Step 2: Follow the prompts, then configure GitHub
# GitHub → Settings → Pull Requests → ✅ Allow auto-merge
# GitHub → Settings → Branches → Add protection for main

# Step 3: Commit and push
git add .vscode .github
git commit -m "[MAYOR] Add autonomous workflow configuration"
git push origin main

# Step 4: Create a task and run the orchestrator
# GitHub → Issues → New → Mayor Task template
# GitHub → Actions → Mayor West Orchestrator → Run workflow
```

**That's it!** Watch Copilot implement your task.

## Task Planning

Use the `plan` command to break down a complex goal into multiple issues:

```bash
npx mayor-west-mode plan
```

**Example session:**

```
? What do you want to build? Build a Pong game

📝 Now break this down into specific tasks:
? Task 1: Create HTML canvas and game loop
? Task 2: Add paddle controls with keyboard  
? Task 3: Implement ball physics and collision
? Task 4: Add scoring system
? Task 5: done

📋 Issue Preview:
1. [MAYOR] Create HTML canvas and game loop
2. [MAYOR] Add paddle controls with keyboard
3. [MAYOR] Implement ball physics and collision
4. [MAYOR] Add scoring system

? Create 4 issues in owner/repo? Yes

✅ Created 4/4 issues!
🤖 Copilot will be assigned automatically by the orchestrator workflow.
```

Each issue is created with the `mayor-task` label, proper formatting, and acceptance criteria. The orchestrator assigns Copilot automatically.

## Safety Guardrails Summary

| Protection | How It Works |
|------------|--------------|
| **Actor Allowlist** | Only actors in CODEOWNERS can trigger auto-merge |
| **Protected Paths** | Critical files (workflows, package.json) require human review |
| **Kill Switch** | Set `enabled: false` in mayor-west.yml to pause everything |
| **Audit Trail** | Every auto-merge documented with PR comment |
| **Command Whitelist** | VS Code YOLO settings auto-approve safe commands only |
| **Blocked Commands** | `rm`, `kill`, `git reset --hard` blocked in VS Code |
| **Iteration Limit** | Stops after 15 iterations (configurable) |
| **Branch Protection** | GitHub enforces status checks before merge |

---

## Local Development

**First time setup:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MayorWest.git
cd MayorWest

# Install dependencies (REQUIRED)
npm install

# Verify installation
npm test
node cli.js help
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Must run `npm install` first!** The CLI and tests won't work without dependencies installed.

**Common issues:**
- ❌ `jest: not found` → Run `npm install`
- ❌ `Cannot find package 'inquirer'` → Run `npm install`
- See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for more help

## Testing

The CLI has **80 automated tests** (45 unit + 35 integration) with 100% pass rate.

```bash
# Run all tests (requires: npm install)
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

**Test Status:**
- ✅ 80 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- ✅ CLI command execution (real `execSync()` calls)
- ✅ File system operations (real fs API)
- ✅ URL parsing & validation
- ✅ Security constraints & error handling
- ⚠️ Code coverage: 0% (tests duplicate logic, see analysis below)

- ✅ Skips draft PRs (Copilot still working)
- ✅ Checks for active Copilot sessions before merge
- ✅ Protected paths require human review

**What's in progress:**
- ⚠️ Complex multi-file refactors may need task splitting
- ⚠️ Cross-repository dependencies not supported

## The Mayor West Mindset

<p align="center">
  <em>"I don't need your approval. I'm the mayor."</em>
</p>

Mayor Adam West doesn't ask for permission. He doesn't second-guess himself. He acts with complete conviction—even when what he's doing makes no sense to anyone else. And somehow, against all odds, things get done.

**This is the philosophy behind Mayor West Mode:**

### The Problem with "Human-in-the-Loop"

Most AI coding tools treat you like a suspicious manager:
- *"Can I edit this file?"*
- *"Can I run this command?"*
- *"Can I commit this change?"*

Click. Click. Click. A hundred tiny interruptions, each one pulling you out of flow. You're not collaborating with the AI—you're babysitting it.

### The Alternative: Policy, Not Approval

A mayor doesn't approve every traffic light change. They set policy, hire competent people, and review outcomes. That's what Mayor West Mode does:

| Instead of... | Mayor West Mode... |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Approving every file edit | Define which paths are protected |
| Approving every command | Define which commands are blocked |
| Watching every commit | Review the PR when it's ready |
| Intervening constantly | Intervene only when needed |

**Configure the guardrails once. Trust the system. Review results.**

### Why This Works

The secret isn't less safety—it's *better* safety:

1. **Humans are bad at repetitive approval tasks.** After the 50th "approve command?" dialog, you're clicking yes without reading. Real security requires designed constraints, not vigilance.

2. **Interruptions destroy deep work.** Cal Newport's research shows it takes 23 minutes to recover focus after an interruption. AI tools that interrupt every 30 seconds make productive work impossible.

3. **Outcomes matter more than process.** You don't need to watch every keystroke. You need tests to pass, code to work, and PRs to be reviewable.

### The Four Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| 🎭 **Autonomous Execution** | Act without waiting for permission |
| 🔒 **Structured Boundaries** | Define what's protected, then trust the system |
| 🔄 **Iterative Resilience** | Fail, learn, retry—automatically |
| 🎯 **Outcome Focus** | Judge by results, not by process |
